# IDS
Still yet another list of Ideographic Description Sequences

This is an unofficial continuation of the IDS Database maintained by the late Andrew West which can be found [here](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/CJK/IDS.TXT).

This repository aims to provide a representation of CJK characters with attention to the differences between source glyph forms. An effort has been made to respect the style of presentation of the original work, the written conventions set out in its documentation, and the unwritten conventions that are observed within its contents.

`babel_supplement` includes the IDS of new ideographs added in Unicode 17.0: 6 in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C (U+2B73A – U+2B73F), 12 in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension E (U+2CEA2 – U+2CEAD), and 4,298 in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension J (U+323B0 – U+33479). Modifications to the original work in its final form are avoided, and no information newer than and including Unicode 17.0 apart from the new glyphs themselves is utilised. No "notes" (cross-reference comments headed by an asterisk) are made. There has been a stark defiance of Principle 2.5 laid out in IRGN1183 ("Generousness on minor differences") in favor of reducing ambiguity and accurately representing the actual glyph form under the stipulations of the documentation's conventions. The possibly excessive detail resulting from this is sometimes balanced by the provision of simpler Z-forms either with ambiguous components or attested otherwise.

Time permitting, I hope to incorporate the new horizontal extensions, iron out mistakes, make additional differentiations between source glyph forms...... in a completely new project, since unfortunately this will not be possible without amending the existing work.

Occasionally, existing IDS lists, https://github.com/yi-bai/ids and https://github.com/chise/ids, have been consulted but never copied from.

Suggestions are welcome.
